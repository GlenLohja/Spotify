# Spotify Time Machine

*SPOTIFY TIME MACHINE*

Using this project the user can type a date/month/year and a new spotify playlist with the top hits of that day will automatically be added in the spotify account.
Change client id and client_secret so it works for your own account . *The info used in this code is just a test spotify account*
